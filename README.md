 A Virtual Machine Image Repository & Catalog
 Developed by the [Grid and High Performance Computing Group (GRyCAP)](http://www.grycap.upv.es) at the
 [Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV)](http://www.upv.es).

0. Introduction
===============
 VMRC is client-server system (based on Web Services) to index and store Virtual Machine Images (VMI)
 along with its metadata (OS, applications, etc.). It supports matchmaking to obtain the appropriate VMIs
 that satisfy a given set of hard (must) requirements and soft (should) requirements.

 It is useful as a catalog of VMIs that can  stored on the VMI repository systems of the different Cloud Management Platforms (such as OpenNebula or OpenStack) or on public Clouds (such as Amazon Web Services).
 This way, customized VMIs are indexed in VMRC and applications can query, as an example, for a VMI based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Java and Octave already installed.

 Current version: 2.1.2

 This repository only includes the VMRC server. Additional packages available in GitHub are:
   - [vmrc-client](http://www.github.com/grycap/vmrc-client) (CLI and Java-based API to access VMRC)
   - [vmrc-web](http://www.github.com/grycap/vmrc-web) (Web-based GUI to access VMRC)

The easiest and fastest way to deploy VMRC is using Docker:
 - [VMRC Docker Image - with GUI (Recommended)](https://hub.docker.com/r/grycap/vmrc-web)
 - [VMRC Docker Image - no GUI](https://hub.docker.com/r/grycap/vmrc)

1. Features
===========
+ Multi-user support.
+ Fine-grained authorization (per User and per VMI).
+ Hypervisor-agnostic
+ OVF support


2. Compilation & Installation
===============

Note that using the [Docker image provided](https://hub.docker.com/r/grycap/vmrc-web) is recommended for easy deployment of VMRC. Proceed at your own risk.

VMRC has been developed in Java using Spring, Hibernate and an SQL-based backend (such as MySQL or HSQLDB).
It is a web service that has to be deployed in an application server (such as Apache Tomcat).

 2.1  Requirements
 ----------------
+ Java JDK 1.7+
+ Maven (to compile from sources and generate the WAR file)  
+ Apache Tomcat (to deploy the WAR). Works on version 7+ up to 7.0.28 included.
  Notice that it might not work with newer versions.
+ (Optional) An SQL-based database (tested on MySQL 5+)

If you are working on Linux (assuming Ubuntu), you can easily install the dependencies (Git, Java + Maven) with:

``
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk git maven
``

Install the appropriate version of Apache Tomcat.


VMRC server can operate with an in-memory database provided by HSQLDB (just for testing).

 2.2 Compilation and Installation (from sources)
 ---------------------------------------------
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/grycap/vmrc.git
```

2. Compile from sources with the command:
```
mvn package
```
If compilation is successful (BUILD SUCCESS), the generated WAR file will be located in target/vmrc.war
3. Deploy vmrc.war into Apache Tomcat (simply drop the war file into Tomcat's webapps folder).
4. Start Apache Tomcat
   * $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
5. VMRC server's endpoint should be available at http://your_ip:8080/vmrc/vmrc (no GUI, just a WS endpoint)
7. Check the VMRC server's manual available at the website http://www.grycap.upv.es/vmrc for further configuration or the [manual] folder in the repo.



3. Configuration
==================

The VMRC Server is pre-configured with an in-memory HSQLDB-based database. This should be employed for testing purposes.
If you want to use another SQL-based backend, proceed accordingly by configuring
``
[TOMCAT_HOME]/webapps/vmrc/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml
``
A MySQL-based configuration is provided for your convenience.

4. Testing
===============
If you want to test VMRC you have to install the [vmrc-client](https://www.github.com/grycap/vmrc-client).
